                    <b>How to read the graph:</b><br>
                    - Each node (circle) represents a hypothesis.<br>
                    - Lines (edges) between nodes indicate similarity between hypotheses.<br>
                    - The number on each edge represents the similarity score. Higher numbers mean greater similarity.<br>
                    - Only similarities above 0.2 are shown.<br>
