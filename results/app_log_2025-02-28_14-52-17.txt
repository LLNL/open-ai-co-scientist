    "title": "Hypothesis 1: Compiler-Driven Instruction Scheduling via Reinforcement Learning for Target-Specific Optimization",
    "text": "Rationale: Current instruction scheduling algorithms often rely on heuristics or static analyses that may not fully exploit the potential of modern, complex processors. This hypothesis proposes using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train an intelligent compiler to dynamically adjust instruction scheduling strategies based on the specific target architecture and workload. The compiler learns the optimal scheduling policy through iterative experimentation (compiling code, running it on the target processor, observing performance metrics, and adjusting the scheduler's parameters). This approach has the potential to outperform traditional scheduling techniques by adapting to nuances of the target architecture and optimizing for real-world performance, rather than relying on abstracted machine models. The RL agent's reward function needs to be carefully designed to balance different performance aspects like latency, throughput, and power consumption."

    "title": "Hypothesis 2: Source Code Understanding with Graph Neural Networks for Semantic-Based Optimization",
    "text": "Rationale: Traditional compiler optimizations often treat source code as a linear sequence of instructions, limiting their ability to reason about the deeper semantic meaning and relationships between different parts of the code. This hypothesis proposes leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build a semantic representation of the source code, capturing data flow, control flow, and variable dependencies. By training a GNN on a large corpus of code, the compiler can learn to identify optimization opportunities based on semantic understanding, such as redundant computations, dead code elimination, or intelligent inlining decisions driven by data dependencies. The learned semantic embedding can also be used to improve static analysis, identifying potential bugs or vulnerabilities that are difficult to detect with traditional methods. The challenge is to create an efficient and scalable GNN architecture that can handle the complexity of real-world codebases."

    "text": "Rationale: Optimizing code for a specific hardware platform often involves a complex trade-off between different compiler optimizations. This hypothesis suggests using Deep Learning (DL) models to predict the performance impact of different compiler optimization sequences on a given hardware platform. The DL model would be trained on a dataset of compiled code, their corresponding performance metrics, and information about the hardware architecture (e.g., CPU type, cache size, memory bandwidth). The trained model can then be used to guide the compiler's optimization choices, selecting the sequences of transformations most likely to improve performance on the target hardware. This allows for hardware-software co-optimization, where compiler decisions are informed by accurate performance predictions, leading to more efficient and tailored code generation. A key aspect is to develop a DL architecture that can capture the complex interactions between compiler optimizations and hardware characteristics."
