While AI in physics is not entirely novel, the integration of advanced AI models (VLMs/LLMs) to achieve human-level insight novelty and drive iterative experimentation is pushing the field forward. The feasibility is rated as medium due to challenges in quantifying 'novelty' and 'quality' of AI-generated insights compared to human physicists, and the complexity of enabling AI to proactively suggest truly meaningful experiments rather than simply optimizing known experimental procedures.
