    "title": "Hypothesis 1: Leveraging Graph Neural Networks for Context-Aware Code Optimization Enables Superior Performance Gains",
    "text": "Rationale: Traditional compiler optimization passes often operate on code through specific intermediate representations (IRs) and have limited context of the overall program structure and data dependencies. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be trained to learn representations of code as graphs, capturing richer contextual information including control flow, data dependencies, and even semantic relationships. By feeding these GNN-learned representations into code optimization passes (e.g., loop unrolling, register allocation), the compiler can make more informed decisions, leading to more effective and efficient code generation. We hypothesize that this approach can automate and surpass the level of optimization achieved by manually designed and hand-tuned heuristic optimization passes or even existing machine learning based optimizations that lack this global context."

    "title": "Hypothesis 2: Reinforcement Learning-Driven Compiler Auto-Tuning Can Achieve Platform-Specific Performance by Adapting Optimization Strategies to Target Hardware",
    "text": "Rationale: Different hardware architectures exhibit unique performance characteristics. Manually tuning compiler flags and optimization pass configurations for each platform is a time-consuming and expert-driven task. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising approach to automating this process. By treating the compiler as an 'agent' and the target hardware as the 'environment', an RL agent can learn optimal optimization strategies through trial and error, guided by performance feedback (e.g., execution time, power consumption). We hypothesize that RL-driven compiler auto-tuning can automatically discover platform-specific optimization strategies that outperform manually tuned configurations, resulting in significant performance improvements and reduced engineering effort for adapting compilers to new hardware platforms."

    "title": "Hypothesis 3: Integrating Formal Verification Techniques with Compiler Design Can Guarantee Functional Correctness and Improve Code Reliability",
    "text": "Rationale: Compilers, due to their complexity, are prone to bugs that can introduce subtle errors in generated code, leading to unpredictable program behavior. While testing can detect some errors, it cannot provide formal guarantees of correctness. Integrating formal verification techniques into the compiler design process can address this challenge. By formally specifying the intended semantics of the source language and each compilation stage, and then verifying that the implemented transformations preserve these semantics, we can ensure the functional correctness of the generated code. We hypothesize that integrating formal verification techniques can substantially improve the reliability of compiled code, reducing the risk of runtime errors and improving overall software quality, especially in safety-critical or security-sensitive applications. This includes using techniques like deductive verification, model checking, or even approaches like proof-carrying code where information derived by the compiler allows for formally verifying code properties at runtime."

  "comment": "The hypothesis combines two promising approaches: reinforcement learning for compiler auto-tuning and graph neural networks for code representation. While each of these areas has been explored individually, the integration of GNNs to enhance RL-based compiler optimization shows potential novelty. However, the novelty level is only medium because simpler combinations of the two technologies may have already been explored in the literature. The feasibility is also medium due to the complexity of training GNNs on large codebases and the computational cost of RL-based exploration. The success of this approach heavily depends on the specific choices of GNN architecture, RL algorithm, reward function, and the types of optimization passes being considered. Further, a significant amount of engineering effort would be needed to integrate GNN representations into existing compiler infrastructures. A clear explanation of how the GNN representation solves the specific limitations of existing machine learning solutions is necessary to make it more novel. Specifically, how does integrating a GNN architecture avoid becoming a 'smart but shallow' heuristic?",

While testing can detect some errors, it cannot provide formal guarantees of correctness. Integrating formal verification techniques into the compiler design process can address this challenge. By formally specifying the intended semantics of the source language and each compilation stage, and then verifying that the implemented transformations preserve these semantics, we can ensure the functional correctness of the generated code. We hypothesize that integrating formal verification techniques can substantially improve the reliability of compiled code, reducing the risk of runtime errors and improving overall software quality, especially in safety-critical or security-sensitive applications.
